                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>SpaceX offers competitive price for its Falcon 9, only 67 million dollars comparing 
                to other providers (more than 150 million dollars each). This advantage price can be 
                obtained by reusing the first stage of rocket. Hence, this project aims to predict 
                the successful rate of landing the first stage after launching rocket.</p>
                <p>The results obtained was up to 91.57% with the features used in analysis and 
                predictions are payload mass, orbit, serial, grid fins, legs, blocks, and landing pad. 
                We then can apply the explored data and predicted results for future rocket launch 
                projects, for new providers who want to step into rocket space market as an useful 
                information, or for venture capitalists to make further decision in their investment.</p>
            </div>

            <p>SpaceX first landing prediction is the capstone project of <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">IBM Data Science Professional Course</a> which 
            I have finished recently. This course provides fundamental and essential skills with overall 
            knowledge about data science from visualizing data to building ML pipeline models. If you are 
            finding the way to step into data science field or to gain an exhaustive overview of it, then 
            this course is not the bad choice.</p>

            <h2>Part I: Understanding Problems</h2>
            <p>Space has mostly been dominated by governments for the last 50 and 60 years ago until 
            billionaires step into and gain some success in space. As space is becoming a potential 
            source of value for businesses across a wide variety of sectors, including agriculture, 
            telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, etc, many space companies are hoping to make it not 
            only just possible but also affordable to put objects into orbit. As a result, a race against 
            time to reduce the cost of launching rockets is happening.</p>
            
            <p>Virgin Galactic is providing suborbital spaceflights, Rocket Lab provides Electronic 
            and Neutron rockets, Blue Origin manufactures sub-orbital and orbital reusable rockets, 
            SpaceX sends spacecraft to the International Space Station and StarLink to provide satellite 
            Internet access. Among them, SpaceX is the clear leader with its Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and 
            Falcon Super Heavy rockets. </p>

            <div className="image-container">
                <img src={Falcon9Price} style={{width: "100%"}}
                    alt="capabilities and services of Falcon9 from spacex.com" />
                <p className="italic center">
                    Capabilities and services of Falcon 9 from spacex.com
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>Falcon 9 is a two-stage launch vehicle powered including first stage, interstage, second 
            stage and fairings. The first stage is matched with the second stage by the interstage. After 
            the rocket launches, the stage seperation happens when the falcon has left the Earth's 
            atmosphere, the first stage engines shut down, boostback and entry burn to make it landed back 
            on the ground. Sometimes, the first stage landed successfully which helps decrease the cost of
            everytime launching rocket (67 million dollars) by reusing the first stage. Other times, it 
            would crash or fail in landing.</p>

            <div className="image-container">
                <img src={Falcon9Structure} className="img-60"
                    alt="Falcon 9 structure of first stage and second stage" />
                <p className="italic center">

                    - picture from Finbarr Sheehy
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>With a high pressure released from the first stage, the second stage continue to fly and
            then move to the fairing and payload seperation (payload is enclosed in the fairings). Stage 
            two, or the second stage, helps bring the payload to orbit, but most of the work is done by 
            the first stage which is much larger and more expensive than the second stage. Therefore, the 
            act of recovering the first stage by making sure it will land successfully is more and more
            crucial.</p>

            <p>If we can accurately predict the likelihood of whether the first stage will land or not, 
            and understand the impact of each feature contributing to the launching mission, the market 
            space will be improved significantly as the cost of satellites and other objects sended to 
            orbit will be lower.</p>

            <h2>Part II: Data Approachs</h2>
            
            <p>The data are collected from <a href="https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SpaceX-API</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falcon_9_and_Falcon_Heavy_launches" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy on Wikipedia</a> by using BeautifulSoup and requests.</p>

            <h3>Collecting data from SpaceX API</h3>

            <p>1. Get the name and cost per launch in rockets path:</p>

                <code className="pl-3">block, reuse_count, serial = get_cores_data(flight["cores"][0]["core"])</code>
            </div>

            <h3>Collecting data from Wikipedia</h3>

            <p>This time we use BeautifulSoup and access contents through CSS selector.</p>
            <p>1. Collect the columns name, and get rid of the br and sup tag: </p>

            <div className="code-container">
                <code>url = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falcon_9_and_Falcon_Heavy_launches"</code>
                <code>r = requests.get(url)</code>
                <code>html_soup = BeautifulSoup(r.text, "html.parser")</code>
                <code>tables = html_soup.select("table.wikitable{`>`}tbody")</code>
                <code>columns = []</code>
                <code>for column in tables[0].find_all("th", scope="col"):</code>
                <code className="pl-3">if column.sup:</code>
                <code className="pl-6">column.sup.extract()</code>
                <code className="pl-3">if column.br:</code>
                <code className="pl-6">column.br.extract()</code>
                <code className="pl-3">column_name = column.get_text(strip=True).replace(",", "").replace(" ", "")</code>
                <code className="pl-3">columns.append(column_name)</code>
            </div>

            <p>2. Handle the date and mass cell by using unicodedata and regex:</p>

            <div className="code-container">
                <code>def get_date(cell):</code>
                <code className="pl-3">datetime = cell.get_text(strip=True)</code>
                <code className="pl-3">datetime = re.search("[^,]+", datetime)</code>
                <code className="pl-3">datetime = cell.get_text(strip=True)</code>
            </div>

            <div className="code-container">
                <code>def get_mass(cell)</code>
                <code className="pl-3">mass = unicodedata.normalize("NFKD", cell.text).strip()</code>
                <code className="pl-3">if mass:</code>
                <code className="pl-6">mass.find("kg")</code>
                <code className="pl-6">new_mass = mass[0 : mass.find("kg") + 2]</code>
                <code className="pl-3">else:</code>
                <code className="pl-6">new_mass = 0</code>
                <code className="pl-3">return new_mass</code>
            </div>

            <p>3. Collect the data: </p>

            <div className="code-container">    
                <code>r = requests.get(url)</code>
                <code>html_soup = BeautifulSoup(r.text, "html.parser")</code>
                <code>rows = html_soup.select("table.wikitable tr[id]")</code>
                <code>for row in rows:</code>
                <code className="pl-3">if row.find("th", scope="row"):</code>
                <code className="pl-6"> ... scrape all data to dataframe ... </code>
            </div>

            <p>After collecting, we convert data into dataframe and handle missing value, invalid data by
            using pandas and numpy, finally turn data into the right types and format.</p>
            
            <h2>Part III: Exploring Data</h2>
            
            <p>We explore data by 3 methods. Firstly, utilize sqlite3 library and using sql magic to 
            do feature analysis and analyze the 2022 launches. Secondly, using seaborn and matplotlib 
            to understand the relationships between features, for example flight number with payload mass, 
            orbit with success rate to help us do feature extraction for further prediction. We also 
            conduct launch sites analysis by using folium to visualize the location of each launch site 
            on the map and calculate the distance from it.</p>

            <h3 >1. How does launch site affect landing status?</h3>

            <p>SpaceX has 3 main launch sites CCSFS SLC-40, total 115 flights, KSC LC-39A, 57 flights, 
            VSFB SLC-4E, 36 flights. Because CCSFS SLC-40 used most for R&D development, this site 
            has high failure rate, the site that has highest successful rate was KSC 91.22% 
            (from 2010-2022).</p>

            <p>Most of ocean landing happened in CCSFS (5 flights) with the successful rate of 80%, 
            VSFB also had 2 flights landing on the ocean, KSC didn't have ocean landing but it has 
            highest successful rate of drone ship landing, and we only have one failure of landing 
            on ground in CCSFS site.</p>

            <p>CCSFS SLC-40 is the site which had most launches, so it's reasonable that it included 
            various orbit launches that the other sites havenâ€™t tried yet. However, the remainders 
            also had its special features, KSC had one sub-orbital and VSFB had one Heliocentric orbit 
            which CCSFS didn't have yet, other than that, when we look carefully, we can observe that 
            the large proportion of SSO and PO orbits were particularly from VSFB launch sites.</p>

            <p>Launch site are in close proximity to coastline, which can help rocket fly over the ocean 
            during launch, crew also has option to abort launch and attempt water landing, and finally 
            minimize the risk from falling debris. Also launch site need to near the railway and highway 
            which allows easily transport for heavy cargo and property, but it is far from city to 
            restrict the danger of launching rockets to population dense areas.</p>

            <p>Another feature is easily noticeable that all launch sites are in proximity to equator. 
            This makes sense as it takes less fuel to get into space from the equator due to the physics 
            of Earth's rotation.</p>

            <h3 >2. The common customers of SpaceX</h3>

            <p>The statistics show that top SpaceX customers are NASA, SpaceX, SES and Iridium 
            communications. We have total 46 flights which are related to NASA, in which NASA(CRS) 
            accounted for the most 26 flights but fewer total payload 71326 kgs comparing to NASA(CTS) 
            6 flights but total payload is 77050 kgs. The average payload mass of each flights of NASA(CRS) 
            is 2743. Most of NASA flights was in CRS projects, it is a contract solution to deliver cargo 
            and supplies to the International Space Station (ISS).</p>
            
            <div className="note-container">
                <p>SES: Luxembourgish leading satellite telecommunications network provider with over 70 
                satellites in two different orbits.</p>
                <p>Iridium communications: Iridium operates the Iridium satellite constellation, a 
                system of 66 active satellites and nine in-orbit spares used for worldwide voice and data 
                communication from handheld satellite phones, satellite messenger communication devices

            <h3 >3. Which does the version of booster have the highest successful rate?</h3>

            <p>Falcon 9 has 5 booster version: v1.0, v1.1, FT, Block 4 and Block 5. Block 5 accounted for 
            most of the flights, it is also the most active rockets of SpaceX which already had 152 flights, 
            Block 5 can carried from 325kgs to 17400kgs with high average payload mass 10625kgs and high 
            successful rate up to 94%.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, v1.0 and v1.1 drew another story, the first version v1.0 didn't have 
            any successful flight, most of the second version v1.1 was crashed. The two rockets developed 
            afterwards in Falcon 9 family are F9 B4 and F9 FT is better for commercial launches, lifting 
            the successful rate to 50%, 75% respectively, but it still cannot compare with F9 Block 5.</p>

            <h3>5. Finding the relationships between features with landing success rate.</h3>

            <p>When the flight number increase, there is a tendency for first stage to land successfully. 
            The figures give the evidence that almost the flights number which is after 100 were launched
            without failing. However, if there is a rise in the mass of payload, the first stage will be 
            less likely to safely landed. Visualization shows that payload mass below 16000 kgs is easier 
            to gain success.</p>

            <div className="image-container">
                <img src={Relationship1} style={{width: "100%"}}
                    alt="The relationship between flight number and payload mass" />
                <p className="italic center">
                    The relationship between flight number and payload mass
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>Different launch sites have different success rate. From the beginning, SpaceX primary 
            launch site was in CCSFS, then during the time of launching flight number 30 to 50, SpaceX 
            moved to VSFB and KSC launch site, there is only VSFB have 100% success rate at that time. 
            Since the flight number 130, SpaceX has equally divided the number of launches into three 
            locations.</p>

            <div className="image-container">
                <img src={Relationship2} style={{width: "100%"}}

                <p className="italic center">
                    The relationship between flight number and launch sites
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>Next, we examine the ralationship between flight number and orbit. In VLEO, MEO, and LEO 
            orbit, the higher the number of flights, the more likely the first stage landed safely. On 
            the other hand, there seems to be no relationship between flight number with in GTO orbit.</p>

                <img src={Relationship3} style={{width: "100%"}}

            <h2>Part IV: Future Launch Prediction</h2>

            <p>Based on the details data about launching features collected, cleaned, and explored in the 
            previous steps, we then utilize the well-designed sklearn library to predict the success rate 
            of the first stage landing. The process includes standardize data, and split it into train and 
            test set with the test size 20%. </p>

            <p>We use the hyperparameter tunning method to train data that mainly focus on 4 types of 
            models containing logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree classifier, and 
            k-nearest neighbors classifier. The result was incredibly satisfying since the accurate rate

            to be the top model that has a stable score of 92% in both train and test set.</p>

            <p>Overall, the number of 92% won't stop here since SpaceX has constantly improved reusable

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            
            <p>It's been a lot fun reading a whole range of documents related to Falcon 9 rocket as well
            as applying accumulated knowledge after completing the course and eventually presenting it 
            here. There's so much about the vastness of space and so many awesome data scientists outside 
            there that I know this report still has shortcomings, so it would be so kind if I could receive 
            some suggestions to expand the ideas, fulfill the contents, and enhance the code.</p>
